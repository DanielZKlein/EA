This is me learning django because it's fun. Also, if I stick with it for long enough, this is going to be a browser game. Turn-based. Team vs team. Every player plays a character with unique abilities. Board-game like feel. 

But that is secondary. Primarily, I'm learning django and not having any fun. Fun is ze enemy.
